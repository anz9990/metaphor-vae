       " 'in the mean time poor alovisa was in all the anxiety imaginable, she counted every hour, and thought em ages, and at the first dawn of day she rose, and calling up her women, who were amazd to find her so uneasy, she employd em in placing her jewels on her cloaths to the best advantage, while she consulted her glass after what manner she should dress her eyes, the gay, the languishing, the sedate, the commanding, the beseeching air, were put on a thousand times, and as often rejected; and she had scarce determind which to make use of, when her page brought her word, some ladies who were going to court desird her to accompany them; she was too impatient not to be willing to be one of the first, so went with them immediately, armd with all her lightnings, but full of unsettled reflections. she had not been long in the drawing-room, before it grew very full of company, but delmont not being amongst em, she had her eyes fixed towards the door, expecting every moment to see him enter; but how impossible is it to represent her confusion, when he appeared, leading the young amena, daughter to monsieur sanseverin, a gentleman, who tho he had a very small estate and many children, had by a partial indulgence, too common among parents, nelecting the rest, maintaind this darling of his heart in all the pomp of quality. the beauty and sweetness of this lady was present death to alovisas hopes; she saw, or fancyd she saw, an unusual joy in her eyes, and dying love in his; disdain, despair, and jealousie at once crowded into her heart, and swelld her almost to bursting; and twas no wonder that the violence of such terrible emotions kept her from regarding the discourses of those who stood by her, or the devoirs that delmont made as he passd by, and at length threw her into a swoon; the ladies ran to her assistance, and her charming rival, being one of her particular acquaintance, shewd an extraordinary assiduity in applying means for her relief; they made what haste they coud to get her into another room and unfasten her robe, but were a great while before they could bring her to herself; and when they did, the shame of having been so disorderd in such an assembly, and the fears of their suspecting the occasion added to her former agonies, and rackd her with most terrible revulsions, every one now despairing of her being able to assist at that nights entertainment, she was put into her chair, in order to be carryd home: amena who little thought how unwelcome she was grown, would needs have one calld, and accompanyd her thither, in spight of the intreaties of delmont, who had before engagd her for his partner in dancing; not that he was in love with her, or at that time believd he coud be touchd with a passion which he esteemd a trifle in itself, and below the dignity of a man of sense; but fortune (to whom this lady no less enamourd than alovisa) had made a thousand invocations, seemd to have allotted her the glory of his first addresses; she was getting out of her chariot just as he alighted from his, and offering her his hand, he perceivd hers trembled; which engaging him to look upon her more earnestly than he was wont, he immediately fancyd he saw something of that languishment in her eyes, which the obliging mandate had describd. amena was too lovely to make that belief disagreeable, and he resolvd on the beginnings of an amour, without giving himself the trouble of considering the consequences; the evening being extremely pleasant, he askd if she woud not favour him so far as to take a turn or two with him in the palace-garden; she, who desird nothing more than such a particular conversation, was not at all backward of complying; he talkd to her there for some time, in a manner as could leave her no room to doubt he was entirelycharmd, and twas the air such an entertainment had left on both their faces, as producd those sad effects in the jealous alovisa. she was no sooner led to her apartment, but she desird to be put to bed, and the good naturd amena, who really had a very great kindness for her, offerd to quit the diversions of the ball, and stay with her all night; but the unfortunate alovisa was not in a condition to endure the presence of any, especially her, so put her off as civilly as her anxiety would give her leave, chusing rather to suffer her to return to the ball, than retain so hateful an object (as she was now become) in her sight; and tis likely the other was not much troubled at her refusal. but how (when left alone, and abandond to the whirlwinds of her passion) the desperatealovisa  behavd, none but those who, like her, have burnd in hopeless fires can guess, the most lively description woud come far short of what she felt; she ravd, she tore her hair and face, and in the extremity of her anguish was ready to lay violent hands on her own life. <b>in this tempest of mind, she continud for some time, till at length rage beginning to dissipate itself in tears, made way for cooler considerations; and her natural vanity resuming its empire in her soul, was of no little service to her on this occasion<b>. why am i thus disturbd? mean spirited as i am! said she, delmont is ignorant of the sentiments i am possessed with in his favour; and perhaps tis only want of incouragement that has so long deprivd me of my lover; my letter bore no certain mark by which he might distinguish me, and who knows what arts that creature might make use of to allure him. i will therefore (pursud she, with a more cheerful countenance) direct his erring search. as she was in this thought (happily for her, who else might have relapsd) her women, who were waiting in the next room, came in to know if she wanted any thing; yes, answerd she, with a voice and eyes wholly changd, ill rise, one of you help me on with my cloaths, and let the other send charlo to me, i have instant business with him. twas in vain for em to represent to her the prejudice it might be to her health to get out of her bed at so unseasonable an hour, it being then just midnight: they knew her too absolute a mistress not to be obeyed, and executed her commands, without disputing the reason. she was no sooner ready, than charlo was introduced, who being the same person that carryd the letter to delmont, guessd what affair he was to be concerned in, and shut the door after him. i commend your caution, said his lady, for what i am now going to trust you with, is of more concernment than my life. the fellow bowd, and made a thousand protestations of an eternal fidelity. i doubt it not, resumd she; go then immediately to the court, tis not impossible but in this hurry you may get into the drawing room; but if not, make some pretence to stay as near as you can till the ball be over; listen carefully to all discourses where you hear count delmont mentioned, enquire who he dances with, and above all, watch what company he comes out with, and bring me an exact account. go, continud she hastily, these are all the orders i have for you to night, but to morrow i shall employ you farther. then turning to her escritore, she sat down, and began to prepare a second letter, which she hopd woud be more lucky than the former. she was not long writing, love and wit suggested a world of passionate and agreeable expressions to her in a moment: but when she had finishd this so full a discovery of her heart, and was about to sign her name to it, not all that passion which had inspird her with a resolution to scruple nothing that might advance the compassing her wishes, nor the vanity which assurd her of success, were forcible enough to withstand the shock it gave her pride: no, let me rather die! said she (starting up and frighted at her own designs) than be guilty of a meanness which woud render me unworthy of life: oh heavens! to offer love, and poorful sue for pity! tis insupportable! what bewitchd me to harbour such a thought, as even the vilest of my sex would blush at? to pieces then (added she, tearing the paper) with this shameful witness of my folly, my furious desires may be the destruction of my peace, but never of my honour, that shall still attend my name when love and life are fled. she continud in this temper (without being able to compose herself to rest) till day began to appear, and and charlo returned with news which confirmd her most dreaded suspicions. he told her that he had gaind admittance to the drawing-room several times, under pretence of delivering messages to some of the ladies; that the whole talk among em was, that delmont was no longer insensible of beauty; that he observd that gentleman in very particular conference with amena, and that he waited on her home in his chariot, her own not being in the way: i knew it, said alovisa, (walking about in a disorderd motion) i did not doubt but that i was undone, and to my other miseries, have that of being aiding to my rivals happiness: whatever his desires were, he carefully conceald em till my cursed letter prompted a discovery; tenacious as i was, and too, too confident of this little beauty! here she stoppd, and wiping away some tears, which in spight of her ran down her cheeks, gave charlo leave to ask if she had any more commands for him. yes (answerd she) i will write once more to this undiscerning man, and let him know, tis notamena that is worthy of him; that i may do without prejudicing my fame, and twill be at least some easement to my mind, to undeceive the opinion he may have conceivd of her wit, for i am almost confident she passes for the authoress of those lines which have been so fatal to me: in speaking this, without any further thought, she once more took her pen, and wrote these words.(part 1, pp. 6-10)',\n",

the iron-work that held it was very high, and strong enough to bear a much greater weight than his; so he made no more to do, but getting on the top of it, was almost to the waste above the bottom of the casement. this was a strange trial, for had she been less in love, good manners would have obligd her to open it;

your denying to go with me, is the only way to make your fears prove true; his jealousy of you may possibly make him more watchful than ordinary, and we are not sure but that this minute he may tear you from my arms;

not a breath but flew wingd with desire, and sent soft thrilling wishes to the soul; cynthia herself, cold as she is reported, assisted in the inspiration, and sometimes shone with all her brightness, as it were to feast their ravishd eyes with gazing on each others beauty; then veild her beams in clouds, to give the lover boldness, and hide the virgins blushes. what now could poor amena do, surrounded with so many powers, attackd by such a charming force without, betrayd by tenderness within: virtue and pride, the guardians of her honour, fled from her breast, and left her to her foe, only a modest bashfulness remaind, which for a time made some defence, but with such weakness, as a lover, less impatient than delmont, would have little regarded. the heat of the weather, and her confinement having hindered her from dressing that day, she had only a thin silk night-gown on, which flying open as he caught her in his arms, he found her panting heart beat measures of consent, her heaving breast swell to be pressd by his, and every pulse confess a wish to yield; her spirits all dissolvd, sunk in a lethargy of love; her snowy arms, unknowing, graspd his neck, her lips met his half way, and trembled at the touch; in fine, there was but a moment betwixt her and ruin, when the tread of somebody coming hastily down the walk, obligd the half-blessd pair to put a stop to farther endearments. it was anaret, who having been left centinel in the garden, in order to open the door when her lady should return, had seen lights in every room in the house, and heard great confusion, so ran immediately to give em notice of this misfortune. these dreadful tidings soon rouzd amena from her dream of happiness, she accusd the influence of her amorous stars, upbraidedanaret,  and blamed the count in terms little differing from distraction, and twas as much as both of them could do, to perswade her to be calm. however, twas concluded that anaret should go back to the house, and return to em again, as soon as she had learnd what accident had occasiond this disturbance. the lovers had now a second opportunity, if either of em had been inclind to make use of it; but their sentiments were entirely changd with this alarm; amenas thoughts were wholly taken up with her approaching shame, and vowd she woud rather die than ever come into her fathers presence, if it were true that she was missd: the count, who wanted not good nature, seriously reflecting on the misfortunes he was likely to bring on a young lady, who tenderly lovd him, gave him a great deal of real remorse, and the consideration that he should be necessitated, either to own an injurious design, or come into measures for the clearing of it, which would in no way agree with his ambition, made him extremely pensive, and wish amena again in her chamber more earnestly than ever he had done to get her out of it; they both remaind in a profound silence, impatiently waiting the approach of anaret; but she not coming as they expected, and the night wearing away apace, very much encreasd the trouble they were in; at length the count, after revolving a thousand inventions in his mind, advisd to walk toward the garden, and see whether the door was yet open. tis better for you, madam, said he, whatsoever has happend, to be found in your own garden, than in any place with me. amena complyd, and sufferd herself to be led thither, trembling, and ready to sink with fear and grief at every step; but when they found all fast, and that there was no hopes of getting entrance, she fell quite sensless, and without any signs of life, at her lovers feet; he was strangely at a loss what to do with her, and made a thousand vows, if he got clear of this adventure, never to embark in another of this nature: he was little skilld in proper means to recover her, and twas more to her youth and the goodness of her constitution that she owd the return of her senses, than his aukward endeavours. when she revivd, the pitious lamentations she made, and the perplexity he was in how to dispose of her, was very near reducing him to as bad a condition as she had been in; he never till now having had occasion for a confident, renderd him so unhappy, as not to know any one person at whose house he coud, with any convenience, trust her; and to carry her to that where he had lodgings, was the way to be made the talk of all paris. he askd her several times if she would not command him to wait on her to some place where she might remain free from censure, till she heard from her father, but coud get no answer but upbraidings from her. so making a virtue of a necessity, he was obligd to take her in his arms, with a design to bring her (tho much against his inclinations) to his own apartment. as he was going thro a very fair street which led to that in which he livd, amena cryd out with a sort of joy, loose me, my lord, i see a light in yonder house, the lady of it is my dearest friend, she has power with my father, and if i beg her protection, i doubt not but she will afford it me, and perhaps find some way to mitigate my misfortunes. thecount  was over-joyd to be easd of his fair burthen; and setting her down at the gate, was preparing to take his leave with an indifference, which was but too visible to the afflicted lady. i see, my lord, said she, the pleasure you take in getting rid of me, exceeds the trouble for the ruin you have brought upon me; but go, i hope i shall resent this usage as i ought; and that i may be the better enabled to do so, i desire you to return the letter i writ this fatal night; the resolution it containd will serve to remind me of my shameful breach of it.(pp. 23-8)',\n",

       " 'the noise she heard in the court, and which she took for the chariot, was nothing more than a little market-cart, which was used to carry home provisions, and which now arrived filled with necessaries for the house; and on its entering the court, she observed one of the servants lock the gate and take the key out. this action seemed to deprive her almost of her reason. she cast a frantic look at me, what, sir, am i a prisoner then? am i to be detained here by force? no, no, i must not suffer this, starting up from her seat, i drew near her, and ventured to lay hold of her hand. let me go, sir; let me be gone from hence this minute. whither would you go, madam? home, home; whither should i go but home to my mama! unkind, said i, tis to falkland you would fly, not to your mama; but remember he is now perhaps the husband of cecilia. what have i done to you, cried she, that you treat me thus inhumanly? a flood of tears succeeded her words. tis a trite observation, that nothing affects a man so much as weeping beauty. i now felt the truth of it, and was really so touched at her tears, that i fell on my knees before her, and said as many tenderly extravagant things, as if i had been actually over head and ears in love; but the obdurate fair was not to be moved. let me be gone, sir, let me go home to my mama, was the burden of her song. but think of the consequences, madam, think of your reputation; tis already known that you have passed two nights in my lodgings. in your lodgings, sir! yes, madam, those apartments in which you spent two nights at brumpton, are mine; it will be known that you left them in my chariot, and that i accompanied you out of town, and that at a time too, when you expected to receive a visit from your uncle. it will be known, that, instead of returning home, you retired to the house of my particular friend, a single man, no lady to bear you company, and that i attended you hither: what must the world think of all this, madam? will it not naturally conclude me to be already possessed of that happy title to which i aspire? and will it not be more for your honour, permit me to say, for the honour of your family too, to give proof to this natural conclusion, than by undeceiving people, to leave them at liberty to judge (pardon me, if i presume to say) perhaps very unfavourably of your conduct? she wrung her hands with all the marks of the bitterest anguish. i endeavoured to sooth her. sometimes i implored her pity, and in the humblest language beseeched her to grant me the return i desired; then again i represented to her the precipice on which she stood. this last idea seemed to strike her with horror, and i really thought, more than once, that she gave some indications of a situation of mind too alarming to name; yet <b>i hope tis nothing but her extreme sensibility, and that after those first violent struggles are over, reason and discretion will reassume their empire<b>; and that finding she has no other party to choose, she will condescend to be lady audley, with no other stain than what matrimony will wipe out, that of running away with her lover, rather than continue miss arnold with an indelible blot on her reputation.(pp. 185-8)',\n",
